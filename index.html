                    Welcome to my page, HORROR fans!!! Thanks for stopping in.
                    I'm excited to take on a little journey through space and 
                    time and TERROR - as only a true horror fan can! As long as I 
                    could remember, I always loved to be scared in a peculiar 
                    fashion. You know --glued to the TV, fingers splayed across 
                    my face strategically spread out so I could still see what 
                    was happening and at the same time protect myself from being 
                    completely freaked out by the jump scare (thereby defeating 
                    the whole effect of the jump scare --DUH!). That never worked
                    anyway. So here I am today with a lot of memories of a lot of
                    scares. <br> 
                    Keep in mind, my history with horror began when I was a kid
                    (about 8) so some of the movies I'll talk about will seem laughable
                    rather than horrific, but nevertheless, they are indelibly etched
                    in my brain as HORROR CLASSICS. Sure the advent of CGI made special
                    effects seem more realistic (So?!), but it's those rough hewn latex and corn syrup blood
                    and guts that will stick with me forever. So, take a few minutes to peek inside my world --
                    if you dare (queue "creepy old guy laugh")!<br><br><br>

            <p>First up: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Dead_(1978_film)" alt="Dawn of the Dead - Wikipedia">
                <em>DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978&#41</em>!</a> 
                This is the movie from which we get that quote which makes
                the blood run cold. You know, when Ken Foree's character says: 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oykvs8ePij8" alt="scene from Dawn Of The Dead">"When there is no more room in Hell,
                    the dead will walk the Earth."</a></p>
            <p style= "text-align:center">Deep.</p>
            <p>So this movie was the 2nd installment in George A. Romero's classic "-Of The Dead Series"</p>
