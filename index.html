        <h1>WHY I LOVE HORROR</h1>
        <p> Welcome to my page, HORROR fans!!! Thanks for stopping in.
        I'm excited to take on a little journey through space and 
        time and TERROR - as only a true horror can! As long as I 
        could remember, I always loved to be scared in a peculiar 
        fashion. You know --glued to the TV, fingers splayed across 
        my face strategically spread out so I could still see what 
        was happening and at the same time protect myself from being 
        completely freaked out by the jump scare (thereby defeating 
        the whole effect of the jump scare --DUH!). That never worked
        anyway. So here I am today with a lot of memories of a lot of
        scares. <br> 
        Remember, my history with horror began when I was a kid
        (about 8) so some of the movies I'll talk about will seem laughable
        rather than horrific, but nevertheless, they are indelibly etched
        in my brain as HORROR CLASSICS. Sure the advent of CGI made special
        effects seem more realistic (So?!)</p>
