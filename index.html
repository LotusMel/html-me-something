                    Welcome to my page, HORROR fans!!! Thanks for stopping in.
                    I'm excited to take on a little journey through space and 
                    time and TERROR - as only a true horror fan can! As long as I 
                    could remember, I always loved to be scared in a peculiar 
                    fashion. You know --glued to the TV, fingers splayed across 
                    my face strategically spread out so I could still see what 
                    was happening and at the same time protect myself from being 
                    completely freaked out by the jump scare (thereby defeating 
                    the whole effect of the jump scare --DUH!). That never worked
                    anyway. So here I am today with a lot of memories of a lot of
                    scares. <br> 
                    Keep in mind, my history with horror began when I was a kid
                    (about 8) so some of the movies I'll talk about will seem laughable
                    rather than horrific, but nevertheless, they are indelibly etched
                    in my brain as HORROR CLASSICS. Sure the advent of CGI made special
                    effects seem more realistic (So?!)

        <h2>A Bird in the Hand</h2>
        <div class="columns3">
            <img src="Images/FlamingosBoys.jpg" alt="Boys looking at flamingos" style=" margin-left: 4%; max-width: 475px; "  />
            <p>
                The bird exhibit was next and outside there was a whole flock of brightly colored Flamingos. The boys posed for the
                camera and as Tristan walked along the fence to see what all he could, Chance watched as the birds wondered about.

            <p>
                We then went inside and had was greated with a great view of the penguins. They dove into the water and spashed about.
                Tristan was able to get close and they followed him along the acrylic wall. He really enjoyed being able to interact
                with the them.

            <br />
        <h2>Sea Lions, Tigers and Bears "Oh My!"</h2>
            <p class="margin10">
                The Seals and SeaLions attracted the boys next. Tristan ran between the wondows watching them glide by as Chance watched 
                and wondered how they did not run into the wall with as close as they were comming to it. When we went inside Chancellor 
                lifted Tristan up to get a vetter view but all Tristan was interested in was trying to get to the ceiling. Chance obliged 
                and held him as high as he could as the seals and sea lions came close. This was definitely the exibit both boys loved most.

        <h2>And Now For The Rest....</h2>
          <div class="columns3">

              <p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 5%">
                Next we headed for the Elephants and there we found a small statue for Tristan to climb on. Chancellor helped. Tristan was 
                amazed at the size of the pacaderms but soon lost interest when he realised he could not get close to them.

            <p class="center">
                The Tapir was enjoying the cool sprinkle and both boys watched him as he pranced about.

                <br />
                Our last stop was the amphebian exhibit and Tristan stared at what looked like a log until it moved. He then sqealed excitedly
                as he pointed at a snapping turtle and claimed "It's a dinosaur!".
