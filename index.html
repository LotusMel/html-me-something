                    Welcome to my page, HORROR fans!!! Thanks for stopping in.
                    I'm excited to take you on a little journey through space and
                    time and TERROR - as only a true horror fan can! As long as I
                    could remember, I always loved to be scared in a peculiar
                    fashion. You know --glued to the TV, fingers splayed across
                    my face strategically spread out so I could still see what
                    was happening and at the same time protect myself from being
                    completely freaked out by the jump scare (thereby defeating
                    the whole effect of the jump scare --DUH!). That never worked
                    anyway. So here I am today with a lot of memories of a lot of
                    scares. <br>
                    Keep in mind, my history with horror began when I was a kid
                    (about 8) so some of the movies I'll talk about will seem laughable
                    rather than horrific, but nevertheless, they are indelibly etched
                    in my brain as HORROR CLASSICS. Sure the advent of CGI made special
                    effects seem more realistic (So?!), but it's those rough hewn latex and corn syrup blood
                    and guts that will stick with me forever. So, take a few minutes to peek inside my world --
                    if you dare (queue "creepy old guy laugh")!

                        First up:
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Dead_(1978_film)"
                            alt="Dawn of the Dead - Wikipedia">
                            <em>DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978&#41</em>!
                        </a>
                        This is the movie from which we get that quote which makes
                        the blood run cold. You know, when Ken Foree's character says:
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oykvs8ePij8" alt="scene from Dawn Of The Dead">"When
                            there is no more room in Hell,
                            the dead will walk the Earth."
                        </a>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center">Deep.</p>
                    <p>So this movie was the 2nd installment in George A. Romero's classic "-Of The Dead Series". The
                        scary
                        the scary thing about this film for me was that most of it was set in a mall. I loved going to
                        the mall
                        and me and my mom would often be at Crestwood Mall on Saturday evenings until they closed. So
                        many times
                        I would look back and watch the mall attendant lock the doors as we walked to our car and
                        imagine
                        they would wander the huge empty shopping center trying on clothes and spraying cologne samples
                        after all
                        the customers had gone. Well, <cite>Dawn Of The Dead</cite> totally ruined that playful
                        rumination for me &#128561. I loved it! <br>This movie served as my matriculation into the world
                        of ZOMBIES! From then on, I was obsessed. I learned the history of zombies from the slow-moving,
                        chomping zombies of pre-Romero films to the tweaky rage zombies of Danny Boyle's<a
                            href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/">
                            28 Days Later (2002)</a>. What I found was a rich history of the undead. Still to this day,
                        I wonder
                        if Macy's or IKEA will be my final refuge when the zombie apocalypse happens.

                        </figure>
                        You guessed it! My next favorite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob">THE
                            BLOB(1958)
                        </a>!!! Holy carnivorous Jell-O &reg;, Batman! What more can I say? So, <em>The Blob</em> is
                        about this red
                        substances that crashes to Earth in a meteor. On impact, the meteor splits open and this dark
                        red goo
                        oozes out. From there it gets kinda gross (by the 1958 standard of gross, of course) because
                        this goo
                        just instantly digests whatever it touches. It eats an old man and then a doctor. By then, it is
                        big and
                        strong enough to take on the town.<a href="https://stevemcqueen.com/">Steve McQueen</a> is the
                        main character who tries to rescue
                        the town from the jello monster. The problem is no one believes him until it's too late -- for
                        them.
                        Suprisingly, this movie did NOT ruin jello for me. It definitely made it more interesting.
                        The other cool thing about this film is it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob_(1988_film)">
                        1988 remake</a> where actor Kevin Dillon is the main character trying to warn the unsuspecting 
                        citizens of Arborville, California. <br>
                        While I still LOVE jello, don't EVER ask me to watch a meteor shower!

                        Last, but certainly not least is the first horror movie to actually give me nightmares --
                        1981's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evil_Dead">The Evil Dead</a> (don't laugh...I was 10).
                        So a group group of college students at cabin in the woods find these tapes which they play on a
                        reel-to-reel. It's some creepy guy saying what sounds like an incantation in a foreign language. Sure enough,
                        the audio wakes up something wicked in the woods. Something <strong><em>evil</em></strong>. As the night 
                        wears on, the students undergo grusome changes as they are alternately possessed by demons. The main character "Ash"
                        (feverishly portrayed by a very young <em>Bruce Campbell</em>), must battle the demons to save his friends
                        and later, himself. This film has everything from its dark and creepy atmosphere, to a gruesome assault by 
                        foliage. The image that made me want to run out of the theater was the one where a demon-possessed 
                        woman tries to escape from the cellar.

                                "For God's sake, what happened to her eyes?!!!".
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        Needless to say, vacationing at a cabin in the woods still sounds like a terrible idea to me. 
                        Especially if said cabin happens to have a cellar. If you're done laughing, I'll have you know that 
                        this movie scared me more than the original 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_(1980_film)">Friday The 13TH</a> film (1980).
